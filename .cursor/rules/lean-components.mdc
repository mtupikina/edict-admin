# Lean Components

Keep Angular components **lean**: small templates, focused responsibility, and minimal inline logic.

## Rules

- **Templates**: If a component template grows large (e.g. > ~80–100 lines), extract logical sections into child components (e.g. tables, dialogs, forms).
- **Single responsibility**: Prefer one main concern per component. Use presentational child components with `input()` / `output()` and let the parent own state and services.
- **Containers vs presentational**: Split “smart” (container) components that load data and handle actions from “dumb” (presentational) components that receive data and emit events.

## Examples

- **Large page with tabs**: Move each tab’s content into its own component (e.g. `roles-table`, `permissions-table`).
- **Dialogs**: Put each dialog (form + footer) in its own component; parent controls visibility and handles save/cancel.
- **Long forms or tables**: Extract the form or table into a dedicated component with clear inputs/outputs.

## Outcome

- Main component template stays short and readable.
- Child components are easier to test and reuse.
- Changes are localized to the right file.
