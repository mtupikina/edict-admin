# No Lint Errors

- **Lint must pass:** All code must satisfy the project's ESLint (and Angular ESLint) rules. No lint errors or warnings are allowed.
- **Before committing:** Run `npm run lint` (or `ng lint`) and fix any reported issues. **Code cannot be committed** until lint is without errors (see commit-gate-tests-and-lint).
- **CI:** Lint should be part of the CI pipeline; the build should fail if lint fails.
- When adding or changing code, ensure new code follows existing lint rules (e.g. use `inject()` where required, avoid `any`, remove unused imports).
